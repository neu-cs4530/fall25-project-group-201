Manual tests done for 3D Viewport: Orbit controls, Orthogonal/Perspective toggling, Camera resetting

Complete manual testing for the 3D viewport is not possible as it is difficult to test how an object
in 3D space has been manupilated. For this visual confirmation, these manual tests have been done, 
accompanied by manual testing in videos - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14h7fymK3txjeT_5irAnuMGz31dY5k1vg?usp=sharing.

Despite this, cypress has been used to test key presses, mouse dragging, button clicking, and 
camera reference hyperlinks. The effects of these actions can be seen in the cypress testing
